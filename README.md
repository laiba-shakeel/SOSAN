# Hospital Management Application
This repository contains a hospital management application built using React Native. It is my first application, and I'm excited to share it with you. The application is designed to serve multiple users with different roles, including hospitals, guests, staff, doctors, insurance providers, accounts, pharmacies, and donation platforms.

# Purpose and Features
The hospital management application aims to streamline various aspects of managing a hospital, improving efficiency and enhancing the user experience. The key features of this application include:

# Hospital Management: Users with hospital roles can access and manage hospital-related information, including patient records, scheduling, and resource allocation.

# Guest Access: The application provides guest access for individuals who want to browse general information about the hospital, such as location, services, and contact details.

# Staff Management: Staff members can utilize the application to manage their schedules, communicate with colleagues, and access important resources.

# Doctors' Portal: The application offers a dedicated portal for doctors to view patient records, update medical histories, schedule appointments, and communicate with patients.

# Insurance Integration: Insurance providers can use the application to verify patient insurance information, process claims, and manage policies.

# Account Management: Users can access their personal accounts to update contact information, view medical history, and track appointments.

# Pharmacy Services: The application includes a pharmacy module where users can order medications, check availability, and receive notifications about prescription refills.

# Donation Platform: The application features a donation platform to facilitate contributions to the hospital or specific causes.

# User Interface
I dedicated 15 days to designing the user interface of this application. I aimed to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface to enhance the user experience. The UI design incorporates modern and user-friendly components, ensuring easy navigation and seamless interactions.

I look forward to further enhancing and refining this hospital management application to meet the needs of users and contribute to the efficient management of healthcare facilities.
